Run programs from Chapter 5 simulating QPSK-DSSS system., Matlab programs are available
in Chapter5.zip file.
- Obtain BER curves for (1) M-code, (2) Gold-code, and (3) an arbitrary code (generated by you
arbitrarily) of the same size. The curves for each code should be for 1,4,7 users and AWGN,
without fading (Similar to Fig. 5.17 of Haradaâ€™s book).
- Also plot (1) autocorrelation functions for the M-code, Gold-code, your code. (2)
Crosscorrelation of two Gold codes; (3) crosscorrelation of a Gold Code and your code.
